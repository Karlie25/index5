			<p><b>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</b>
				<br>
				I don’t think one is better than the other between the two ideological camps. I guess depending on what concepts that I am doing, what emotions and ideas I want to deliver to audiences, I would choose whether flat or skeuo suit the best. I agreed with Frank Chimero in their blog “What screens want” that a screen is no different from a piece of paper, so it is not fair to say, “we made things look a certain way because the screen cared one way or the other.” The horse example proved that the screen did great, showing various styles and forms of design of one object. I don’t think it is true to say because the screens are flat so designs should be flat too.

				<b>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</b>
				<br> 
				Zoopraxiscope is a device that contains a sequence of photos, and it can be spun to create the movement of action. In “What screens want,” Frank Chimero pointed out that the looping animated imagery produced by zoopraxiscope inspired the animated GIF in interactive media. An example from filmmaking that has inspired digital design is the idea of stimulating the experience from any environment that may be completely different from our actual environment. In the book, The Theater And Its Double, Antonin Artaud mentioned the idea of Virtual Reality. Damien Broderick also wrote about this idea in his science fiction book called The Judas Mandala. In 1956, Morton Heilig-who worked in the Hollywood motion picture industry, built a machine called Sensorama to make users feel like they are in a movie. That machine was a foundation of VR today-the technology that is widely used in games and web design.

				<b>3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not. </b>
				<br>
				I agreed that screens want “Flux”-the capacity of change. Flux is necessary for screens since technology changes rapidly. The adaptation ability will allow web designers to make their designs compatible with innovation constantly. As a result, they can connect to more people through multiple screens of many devices.   </p>
