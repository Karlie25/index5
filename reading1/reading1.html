	<p><b>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</b>
		<br>
	 When giving the critique, the biggest challenge that I face is how I can help the people I critique not feeling belittle instead feeling good to make their works better. I agreed with Mitch Goldstein in "How to crit" that crit should have goals on the expectations because it helps the suggestions and ideas go in the right directions. Sometimes, I afraid of misleading the person that I give critique to going on the wrong way because I am not sure whether or not they fully understand what I am trying to say.
	<br>

	<b>2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</b>
	<br> 
	When I receive a critique that I disagree with, I will tell that person why I do not think the way they think. Additionally, I will ask them some questions to clarify and make sure they understand the reasons why I do what I do. On the other hand, there is a chance that I misunderstand their point of view, so by asking questions, and I would learn more about their opinions. I understand that everyone has their own way of thinking. At the end of the discussion, I will do some reflections of what are the best fit for my own practices. 
	<br> 

	<b>3. Why do you think itâ€™s important to give and receive critiques? </b>
	<br>
	It is essential to receive and to give critique because critique will make each other learn and grow. First of all, critique will help the receivers recognize the problems they made in their works that they did not see before learning from others' perspectives. Secondly, giving critique is a chance to learn new methods of how to solve some problems from peers' discussions. Both are giving and receiving critique are necessary for the design process. </p>
