			<p><b>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </b>
				<br>
				Lialina wanted to keep using the word “user” instead of completely denying it because the term “users” will help distinguish groups of people, developers, and people who use products developed by developers. Lialina emphasized the importance of users knowing their rights and how to protect them. Without the distinction between users and the developers, these rights, such as asking for better software, deleting files, getting files back, etc., may be taken away.  
				<br>

				<b>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</b>
				<br> 
				According to Lialina, the ideal internet users are the General Purpose Users. They can modify the initial technologies purposes work for their demands. The qualities that Lialina outlines in the article that the General Purpose Users can achieve what they want regardless of the primary purposes of apps or devices they use. For example, they will write an article for their email clients, layout business cards in Excel, shave by using a webcam, or do not need Flickr to post their photos, etc. They find the ways to their aspirations without being limited by apps and programs.   
				<br> 

				<b>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</b>
				<br>
				An example from my own experiences interacting on the web and on the app where there are “gaps that can be filled by users” is SimSimi. SimSimi is a chatting robot that uses artificial intelligence to communicate with users. The chatting robot can provide appropriate response sentences based on more than 130 million scenarios in 81 languages written by over 22 million panelists. To make SimSimi get closer to real human life, users can teach SimSimi slang and respond in specific scenarios to customize more personal and emotional conversations. Because SimSimi keeps learning from many different users, it talks more and more like an absolute best friend. This feature attracts more new users coming to talk to SimSimi.
