			<p><b>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer. </b>
				<br>
				I agreed with Laurel Schwulst's points when she suggested individuals should have their website instead of only using social media. First of all, I agree that popular social media sites like FaceBook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc., are the companies that earn benefits through advertising so that users are not their primary concern. It is true that "no one is looking for you, but you" since many people like ourselves go on social media to seek attention, everyone wants to pop up, etc. Because social media uses the same design layout and how designs should be presented, artists have some limitations within that design. An individual website allows creators to design everything on their own. Through the website, audiences can see if the artists' styles and ideas fit the projects more precisely.  
				<br>

				<b>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison.</b>
				<br> 
				Website as building Lego.
				<br>
				Like building your world by using multiple Lego plastic construction pieces, having your website allows you to have the freedom to control how you want to show yourself to the world. Your creativity is not limited by an already set up social media-designed layout. It is like you have your control when you decide to put two Lego bricks together. There is no right or wrong way to randomly try out new shapes or carefully plan what forms you want to build with Lego. The outcomes always reflect your true colors as a designer. It illustrates your identity, possibilities, your ideas, etc. And like building Lego, creating a website is a long process, and we should not rush that process. It takes time to refine and improve.
