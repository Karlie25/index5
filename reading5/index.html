			<p><b>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</b>
				<br>
				In my opinion, when Seu asks people to join her to "defamiliarize our tools," she means that we should put some thoughts and considerations when we are using digital technology. Analyzing tools constraints help the readers to actually understand how the virtual world works on a deeper level than just using them and accepting them as the way they are. Mindy Seu pointed out that many of us use our devices unconsciously. Instead, we should take some time to figure out the limitations of the tools we use. Knowing these imperfect details of early computer art will help us be aware of poetic potentials. 
				<br>

				I think the action of "defamiliarizing our tools" is the first step to understanding how technology's limited capabilities can shape the appearance of computer art. By "defamiliarizing our tools," people can explain how tools guide users' work on the virtual platform.
				<br>

				Seu said," technology is a form of language." Technology and language have some similar characteristics. First of all, they both evoke an image of experience and emotions. Secondly, they keep growing and dying in the process of adapting to the contemporary situation. "Defamiliarize our tools" is an act of learning the basic rules, and by understanding those rules, we invent new stuff.  
				<br>

				<b>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</b>
				<br> 
				Removing Function from Form is the poetry of tools where artists did not use the tools that they use based on the original purpose that those tools were created in the first place. 
				<br>
				This is the website that operates within the definition of Removing Function from Forms is: 
				<br>
				<a href="http://ascii.designforthe.net/">http://ascii.designforthe.net/</a>
				<br>
				The artists used ASCII characters-a characters set for computers and electronic devices in the early '60s to draw buildings on that website. The letterforms not only represent words or sentences, but they also use the forms themselves to illustrate architectural shapes creatively. I also consider that project fits in the Regeneration category as well. The old character set from the past was preserved and used innovatively in a contemporary media art project.
